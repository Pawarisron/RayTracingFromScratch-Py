# RT-python-week03
Ray tracing course week 03

This repository is for 'Raytracing in Entertainment Industry' (01418283).
This course is set to be taught for undergrad students at Dept of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University.
The codes were rewritten and modified from https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.

**Prerequisites :**
1. C/C++ or python.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Linear algebra for undergrad students.


**Class assignment**

1. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render a square with various sizes and locations using different 't' and 'Interval'. Save your render result as "week03-1.png". Submit the rendered image and your modified code.
2. Modify 'find_intersection()' to render 3 squares with various sizes and locations. Save your render result as "week03-2.png". Submit the rendered image and your modified code.
3. Replace 'get_center_ray()' with 'get_ray()'. Render the result. Save your render result as "week03-3.png". Explain the differences between (2.) and (3.). Additional please submit the rendered image.
4. Generate random rays at the same pixel using 'get_ray()' and 'samples_per_pixel'. The result from 'get_color()' is then accumulated to 'pixel_color' and scaled in 'write_to_film()'. See the difference between (3.) and (4.). Save your render result as "week03-4.png". Submit the rendered image and your modified code.
5. Draw Class diagram of the codes.
