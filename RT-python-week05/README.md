# RT-python-week05
Ray tracing course week 05

This repository is for 'Raytracing in Entertainment Industry' (01418283).
This course is set to be taught for undergrad students at Dept of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Kasetsart University.
The codes were rewritten and modified from https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html.

**Prerequisites :**
1. C/C++ or python.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Linear algebra for undergrad students.


**Class assignment**

1. Implement direct lighting effect in the 'compute_scattering()' method. As of now, the direct lighting only handle point lights.
2. Add a point light source (white color [1.0,1.0,1.0]) at the location (0,0,0) and render it with the scene in 'renderPointLight()'.
3. Keep quad patches on the left and the right (remove the rest). Keep the point light at the location (0,0,0). Render it and compare the differences between results from (2.) and (3.). 
4. Explain why the result from (3.) has different illumination compared to (2.).
5. Add a render function called 'renderPointLightShadow()' by changing the location of the point light to (4,0,0). Render the scene and explain the rendered result.
6. Create a scene containing spheres and quads then light the scene up with a point light.
